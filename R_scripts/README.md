**1. Static and intercative bubble plot**: 

This script returns a bubble chart in which the bubble size corresponds to the normalized correlation (Ncor) and colors refer to the statistical significance.  

Using the Plotly's R graphing library, we can transforme the static chart to intercative one [See example](http://localhost:15345/session/viewhtml3b0f4687e847/index.html). The Plotly.R is free and open source.
