### Raw data material
Eight peach RNA-sequencing datasets of various peach cultivars under different stress conditions and from various tissues were used for this project. All the raw data files were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena).

### Quality control
Quality metrics of the raw sequences was assessed using FASTQC v.0.11.5 and Trimmomatic v.0.36.
